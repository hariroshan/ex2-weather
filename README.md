# Weather App using Elm Native

We will use [Nativescript GeoLocation Plugin](https://docs.nativescript.org/plugins/geolocation.html) to get current device location. Don't forget to add location permission.

Then we will sent this coordinates to [Open Weather API](https://home.openweathermap.org/) to get the weather details with the help of `elm/http`.
